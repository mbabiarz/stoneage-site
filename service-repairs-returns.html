    <h2 class="section-heading margin-top-30">Lead Time</h2>
    <p>Call or email your order to StoneAge or an authorized dealer with purchase order number, shipping and billing addresses, and delivery date. Check datasheet to ensure specifications are complete. Advise whether we should hold shipment until all items are available.</p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Ordering</h2>
    <p>Shipping is pre-paid and invoiced with order but may be charged directly to the customer’s account with selected courier by special instruction. Most orders are shipped via UPS or Fed Ex couriers; specify a preference if you wish. Larger equipment will be shipped by truck or air freight. Either party may make the arrangements. Airline counter-to-counter delivery is not reliable from our mountain location.</p>
