          <h2>Legal basis to process personal data</h2>
          <p>Under the applicable data protection laws, we need a lawful basis to collect and use your personal data. The law allows for personal data to be legally collected and used if it is necessary for a legitimate interest of the organization.</p>
          <p>In conducting commercial business, it is not practical for us to ask every individual for his/her consent. We have assessed our business interests in carrying out marketing activities and considered the impact the collection and use of personal data could potentially have on individuals’ rights. Our databases contain business data, which is used to promote business globally and such activities are unlikely to affect the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals concerned. We have therefore concluded that the most appropriate lawful ground for the processing of your personal is ‘legitimate interest’, in your capacity as representative of your company (b2b).</p>
          <p>In the event you request any goods and/or services from us, we will rely on our contractual relationship to process your personal data to provide such goods and/or services to you.</p>
          <p>In certain very limited circumstances, we may also rely on a specific consent provided by you for the processing of your personal data. In those circumstances you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us – see our contact details below.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:0;">We may use information held about you in the following ways, to:</p>
          <ul style="margin-bottom:20px;">
            <li>Ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;</li>

          <h2>Onward transfer</h2>
          <p>StoneAge is a global corporation with operations in several countries. We have developed global data practices designed to assure Personal Information is appropriately protected. While our primary data centers are in the USA, UK, and the Netherlands, we may transfer Personal Information to StoneAge offices or representatives outside of our primary data centers. In addition, we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. If we disclose Personal Information to a third party or to StoneAge employees outside of the USA, UK, and the Netherlands, we will ensure that such party has agreed to abide by the principles of this policy, or can otherwise assure adequate protection of such Personal Information.</p>

          <h2>Marketing and other activities</h2>
          <p>When submitting a form on StoneAge websites or mobile app, you may have the option of receiving information from us. These options include promotional information, press releases, and general updates. We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or you may contact the StoneAge marketing team at +1-970-259-2869 or <a href="mailto:marketing@stoneagetools.com">marketing@stoneagetools.com.</a></p>
          <p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in response to issues relating to your account via email or phone.</p>
          <p>We may utilize information generated through use of our online services for marketing research, such as compiling statistics on website visitors and assessing market trends and customer needs. We may collect and store information provided directly or indirectly to us through participation in online contests and/or client satisfaction surveys and the like. We may create standard usage logs through our web server, such as IP address, browser type, and access times. We use our web server to recognize your domain name and track your use of the website.</p>
          <p>We may request certain information from you (e.g. name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or business requirements) to help us evaluate our site traffic and overall usage, improve our on-line services, and build better websites. We may add information from third parties to this collected information, for instance to research prospective clients.</p>
          <p>We may post customer testimonials on our websites and social media channels which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer’s name. We obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting the testimonial. If you wish to request the removal of your testimonial, you may contact the StoneAge marketing team at +1-970-259-2869 or <a href="mailto:marketing@stoneagetools.com">marketing@stoneagetools.com</a>.</p>
