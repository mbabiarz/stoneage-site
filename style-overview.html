    <p>This guide was created for StoneAge employees to reference when writing for StoneAge. It helps us to communicate in a consistent manner across teams and channels, and take into account the audience being addressed.</p>
    <h1 class="thin grey spaced margin-bottom-30">Content goals and principles</h1>
    <p>With every piece of content we publish, we aim to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inform and empower.</strong> Help people to make the most of our products.</li>
      <li><strong>Respect.</strong> Treat readers with the respect they deserve. Put yourself in their shoes, and don't patronize them. Remember that they have other things to do. Be considerate and inclusive. Don't market at people; communicate with them.</li>
      <li><strong>Educate.</strong> Tell readers what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them the exact information they need, along with opportunities to learn more.</li>
      <li><strong>Guide.</strong> Think of yourself as a tour guide for our readers, communicate in a friendly and helpful way.</li>
      <li><strong>Speak truth.</strong> Understand StoneAge's place in our customers' lives. Avoid dramatic storytelling and grandiose claims. Focus on our real strengths.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order to achieve these goals, we make sure our content is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clear.</strong> Understand the topic you're writing about. Use simple words and sentences.</li>
      <li><strong>Useful.</strong> Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?</li>
      <li><strong>Friendly.</strong> Write like a human.</li>
      <li><strong>Appropriate.</strong> Write in a way that suits the situation. Just like you do in face-to-face conversations, adapt your tone depending on who you're writing to and what you're writing about.</li>
    </ul>
