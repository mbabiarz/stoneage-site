New state of the art in-house testing facilities allow the dedicated engineering team to continue to push the boundaries of design. By partnering with industrial cleaning contractors, StoneAge engineers are able to gain unique insight that guides the design of automated systems that increase safety and advance productivity for a wide variety of waterblasting applications.
