    <h1 class="thin grey spaced margin-bottom-30"><em>StoneAge Inc. is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of automated waterblast equipment and tooling for industrial companies and contractors worldwide.</em></h1>
    <p>StoneAge was launched in 1979 when co-founders John Wolgamott and Jerry Zink developed a new self-rotary waterjet nozzle in their garage. Originally intended for the mining industry "to cut holes in rock," the nozzles changed the way heat exchangers were cleaned. The founders' passion for research and development bred a culture of product innovation where the commitment to designing new tools and equipment has improved the way the waterblasting industry works for over 35 years.</p>
    <p>This passion for product leadership has brought StoneAge engineering to the forefront of the movement toward hands-free waterblast equipment. New state-of-the-art, in-house testing facilities allow a dedicated engineering team to continue to push the boundaries of design. By partnering with industrial cleaning contractors, StoneAge engineers are able to gain unique insight that guides the design of automated systems that increase safety and advance productivity for a wide variety of waterblasting applications. With an unmatched dedication to  engineering innovation and customer service, StoneAge is proud to lead the way toward a safer, more efficient industry.</p>
    <p>Quality StoneAge products for industrial, sewer, and downhole cleaning, as well as custom engineered equipment for application-specific challenges, are distributed worldwide from our sales and rental facilities and across a global network of over 90 dealers in 35 countries.</p>
