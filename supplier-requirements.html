      <p>That said, StoneAge has recently shifted our business model in ways that have impacted all departments. This requires us to take a close look at our processes, directly relating to non-conforming material, time lost and in-house rework fees.</p>
      <p>In 2016, we reduced the number of Suppliers who provide fabricated parts. We reduced our business with Suppliers who were underperforming and consolidated business with the remaining Suppliers. We will continue to carefully evaluate our Supply Partners and make changes to our supply chain as needed.</p>
      <p>Due to the increase in part numbers and the need to drive consistency among our Suppliers, we are implementing new Supplier requirements for our policy starting 2017.</p>
