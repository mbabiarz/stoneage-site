        <h2>Living In Durango</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>Durango is one of those special places: a small mountain town (population approx. 16,000) located within a unique tri-city county (population approx. 50,000) on the banks of the Animas River, with a vibrant community and access to countless sports and activities. In fact, Durango was recently named the top “micropolitan” town in America.</p>
        <p>Tourists are drawn by nearby Mesa Verde National Park, the Durango &amp; Silverton Narrow Gauge Railway and Purgatory Ski Resort, but those of us who make our home here know there’s so much more to appreciate. What we lack in shopping malls and freeways, we make up for with the genuine friendliness of the people, the lively arts and music scene, the world-class restaurants, the strong ranching and farming heritage of the area, the excellent schools and library and medical care, etc. And for the outdoor enthusiast, the opportunities are endless: fly fishing, horseback riding, mountain biking, downhill and Nordic skiing, snowboarding, hiking, backpacking, kayaking, 4-wheeling, and much more.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://yeslpc.com/best-places-to-live-durango/" target="_blank">La Plata County Economic Development Alliance produced a series of videos</a> that explore aspects of the Durango and La Plata County lifestyle, featuring members of the StoneAge team!</p>
