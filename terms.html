          <h2>Acceptance of Terms and Conditions</h2>
          <p>Receipt of these Terms and Conditions of Sale (“Terms and Conditions”) shall operate as the acceptance by StoneAge, Inc. (“Seller”) of the order submitted by the purchaser (“Buyer”).  Such acceptance is made expressly conditional on assent by Buyer to these Terms and Conditions.  Such assent shall be deemed to have been given unless written notice of objection to any of these Terms and Conditions (including inconsistencies between Buyer’s purchase order and this acceptance) is given by Buyer to Seller promptly on receipt hereof.</p>
          <p>Seller desires to provide Buyer with prompt and efficient service.  However, to individually negotiate the terms of each sales contract would substantially impair Seller’s ability to provide such service.  Accordingly, the product(s) furnished by Seller are sold only according to the terms and conditions stated herein and with the terms and conditions stated in any effective StoneAge Dealer Agreement or StoneAge Reseller Agreement, if applicable.  Notwithstanding any terms and conditions on Buyer’s order, Seller’s performance of any contract is expressly made conditional on Buyer’s agreement to these Terms and Conditions unless otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by Seller.  In the absence of such agreement, commencement of performance, shipment and/or delivery shall be for Buyer’s convenience only and shall not be deemed or construed to be an acceptance of Buyer’s terms and conditions.</p>

The prices shown on the face hereof are those currently in effect.  Prices invoiced shall be per pricelist in effect at the time of shipment.  Prices are subject to increase for inclusion of any and all taxes which are applicable and which arise from the sale, delivery or use of the product(s), and the collection of which Seller is or may be responsible to provide to any governmental authority, unless acceptable exemption certificates are provided by Buyer in accordance with applicable law.
