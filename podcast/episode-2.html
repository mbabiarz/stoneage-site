    <p><strong>Guest:</strong> Marlies Tump, Operations Manager at <a href="http://www.training-cursuscentrum.nl/" target="_blank">Training &amp; Cursus Centrum</a>, also known as TCC, based in the Netherlands. Marlies started her career as a 17-year-old on the police force and had to retire early because of a knee injury. Lucky for us she found her way to Peter Goedendorp, founder of TCC, who saw potential in her at a job fair. Ten years later, her ability to work with all types of people and aptitude for planning brought her to where she is today. Marlies is very active in the industrial cleaning industry and has a unique perspective due to TCCâ€™s focus on creating training and onboarding procedures to ensure safety across the industry.</p>
