    <p><strong>Quick Background:</strong> Host Kerry Siggins is joined by John Wolgamott, co-founder of StoneAge Inc. John details starting the company alongside co-founder, Jerry Zink, with a “waterjet rock drill” used for uranium mining, and its subsequent pivot towards manufacturing rotary tools and automated equipment for the industrial cleaning industry. He describes how their mutual focus on taking care of customer needs has helped guide the business’s growth internationally as well as its product development evolution. John explains why StoneAge became an employee-owned company and his passion for growing the Employee Stock Ownership Program further. Kerry and John discuss frequently asked questions including where the name “StoneAge” came from, why the company has never developed a pump, and why its headquarters is firmly located in Durango. Plus, John shares his vision for the industry and the role StoneAge plays in delivering the next generation of smarter, safer industrial cleaning equipment.</p>
