    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In this special episode of Industrial Theory, host Kerry Siggins is joined by two familiar faces: StoneAge Director of Engineering, Kelley Crush, and Director of Global Sales, Mike Taylor. Kelley and Mike share exciting news about StoneAge’s latest system, the Compass. Formerly known as the ProPositioner, the Compass is an automated indexing device that articulates in a radial motion from one attachment point to easily clean all tubes in and around a heat exchanger bundle. Kelley details how this reduces the need for contractors to perform dangerous confined space cleaning operations. Explaining the evolution of this product, Mike shares how StoneAge works closely with customers to develop products that drive the industry forward. Learn about the extensive engineering and customer collaboration that produced the Compass’s game-changing ability to clean every tube with precision and ease. Plus, they hint at what’s coming down the pipe for Sentinel Automation Technology. </p>
