          <h2>4. How We Use Your Information </h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom:0;">We generally use your information for the following business and commercial purposes:</p>
          <ul style="margin-bottom:20px;">
            <li>To provide our Services, including to answer any questions or inquiries you make to us, perform a contract with our clients or Service Providers, and provide customer support to you.</li>
            <li>With your consent, in accordance with that consent. For example, if you request customer support, we will use the information you provide to evaluate your specific request and contact you.</li>
            <li>To comply with applicable laws, in response to a lawful and enforceable request by a law enforcement, judicial, or other public authority, or in connection with an applicable legal obligation.</li>
            <li>For another StoneAge business or commercial purpose. For instance, we may use your information to assist with fraud prevention, report suspected criminal activity to law enforcement, and to help prosecute individuals responsible for malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>a) How We May Share Information We Collect</strong> StoneAge may share your information, including Personal Information, with a variety of parties depending on the purpose for and context in which you provided the information. We generally share the information with the following types of recipients:</p>
          <ul style="margin-bottom:20px;">
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We employ third-party Service Providers, companies, individuals, and agents to facilitate and help us provide our Services to you (“Service Providers”). Such Service Providers perform tasks or functions on our behalf, provide Services-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our Services are used or delivered. For instance, we may disclose information to our database and cloud storage providers that help us maintain the Services.<br><br>
            The Services Providers we share your Personal Information with in the provision of the Services are: Amazon Web Services and MongoDB, Inc.<br><br>
            These third parties are granted access to your information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Corporate Transitions:</strong> Your Personal Information may be processed in the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation, or sale of all or a portion of our assets. For example, Personal Information may be part of the assets transferred, or may be disclosed (subject to confidentiality restrictions) during the due diligence process for a potential transaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Disclosures:</strong> In limited circumstances, we may, without notice or your consent, disclose your Personal Information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you to the extent we believe such disclosure is legally required, to prevent or respond to a crime, to investigate violations of our Terms of Use, or to protect the vital interests of us or any person. Note, these disclosures may be made to governments that do not ensure the same degree of protection of your Personal Information as your home jurisdiction. We may, in our sole discretion (but without any obligation), object to the disclosure of your Personal Information to such parties.</li>
